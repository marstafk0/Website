                      <h6 class=" u-text u-text-2">Junior Software Developer</h6>
                      <p class="u-align-justify  u-text u-text-3"> I may be new in the wonderful world of coding, but I am certainly not unfamiliar. I am a 20 year old developer, my interest in code began back in 2013, but I didn't do much besides mess around in Javascript files, trying to create my own mods in Minecraft. Though I didn't have unfettered access to a computer, I went to the library every week, reading what I could on computers and coding. eventually it became official when I acted on the urge to get a job in coding, leading me to find The Software Guild, an online bootcamp to help people jump into the industry quickly.</p>

                      <p class=" u-text u-text-4"> Thats what I wanted. A quick jump into a world I knew about for a long time but never lept into. Though my grades have always been good, I didn't want to go to college, at least not if I can get away without it. None-the-less, I am the most driven guy I know. I started working at a pizza place when I was 15, and became assistant manager by 16.&nbsp; I started to get into building my own PC's, I built a decent build, Corsair themed with a GTX 1060 and Ryzen 7 2700x, and from built both my brothers', cousins' etc. to say the least I've built well over 50 working systems, be it old un-used or new parts. I've built dedicated server computers and got into server hosting, VPNs, switches, all the fun networking stuff. I dabbled in game developement, everything from Unity to Unreal, I've taken a plethora of Udemy courses, but eventually I wanted some structure, and a job. This is a website I will keep updated, down below you can find my resume and extended experience, with projects linked to the project page.</p>
